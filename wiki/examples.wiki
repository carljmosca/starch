The first example has been posted.  The project is called StarchDemo and currently contains a JComboBox example.  More specifically it's what we used to call a LookupComboBox back in our Delphi days.  The JComboBox will display a list of values with have assoiciated keys.  The key values are what returned (and bound) to the target.  A trivial real world example might be a Person which has a favorite color code.  The JComboBox can contain a list of colors.  The selectedItem of the JComboBox should be bound to the favorite color code property of the Person bean.  In order for this to work, we use the LookupConverter.
