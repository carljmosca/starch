#labels BeansBinding,JComboBox,lookup
The first example has been posted.  The project is called StarchDemo and currently contains a JComboBox example.  More specifically it's what we used to call a LookupComboBox back in our Delphi days.  The JComboBox will display a list of values which have assoiciated keys.  The key values are bound to the target.  

A trivial real world example might be a Person which has a favorite color code.  The JComboBox can contain a list of colors.  In order for this to work, we use the LookupConverter.  For convenience we also use the LookupList which contains an ObservableList.  At design time we can drop a JComboBox on a form along with a LookupConverter and LookupList.  The LookupConverter's list property should be set to the LookupList.  The elements property of the JComboBox is bound to the LookupList.  The selectedItem property of the JComboBox is bound to the favorite color property of the Person bean.  Then the only code to write is a couple of lines which will populate the list.
