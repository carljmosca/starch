We had to call it something.  The words beans and binding has to bring something to mind besides making programming easier.  Shannon Hickey has done a technical session at [http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/index.jsp JavaOne] called [http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/j1sessn.jsp?sessn=TS-6657&yr=2008&track=desktop  Beans Binding: Good for the Heart] and the PDF is a good introduction.

Our thought was Beans Binding isn't done but we've been using it since version 0.6.1.  It has certainly matured and in our opinion works nicely in [http://netbeans.org NetBeans].  There are however some things missing.
